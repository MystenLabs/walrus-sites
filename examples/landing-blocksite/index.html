    <h1>Hello, welcome to a <span class="rainbow-text">BlockSite!</span></h1>

    <h2>BlockSites are "web"-sites that live entirely on Sui</h2>
    <p>
        No web involved! The content of this blocksite is loaded from an object on Sui.
        The object contains all the resources necessary to render this page.
        To browse a blocksite, you just need its <b>Sui Object ID</b>.
        No wallet is needed to browse blocksites, and publishing to Sui is extremely inexpensive!
    </p>
    <h2>How does it work?</h2>
    <p>
    <ul>
        <li>Each blocksite is represented by objects on Sui, which contain a version of the blocksite</li>
        <li>Once the blocksite portal is loaded, it downloads a service worker that <b>gets the contents of the objects
                from the Sui blockchain</b> and serves them to the browser.</li>
        <li>People can browse any blocksite by just typing its object ID (in base36 encoding) as a subdomain to the blocksite portal
            url.</li>
        <li>The service worker in the portal then fetches the objects from the full node and displays them. That's it!</li>
    </ul>
    </p>
    <h2>How can i publish a blocksite?</h2>
    <p>
        By using the <code>site builder</code> tool.
    </p>
    <h2>Some test sites</h2>
    <p> Have a look at some of the test blocksites we have created:</p>
    <ul>
           <li>A <a href="./features.html">features page</a> for the project</li> 
           <li>A <a href="./image/bullshark.html">site with javascript and images </a></li>
           <li><a href="./snake/index.html">Play snake!</a></li>
    </ul>
