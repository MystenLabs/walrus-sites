    <h1>Hello, welcome to a <span class="rainbow-text">BlockSite!</span></h1>

    <h2>BlockSites are "web"-sites that live entirely on Sui</h2>
    <p>
        No web involved! The content of this blocksite is loaded from an object on Sui.
        The object contains all the resources necessary to render this page.
        To browse a blocksite, you just need its <b>Sui Object ID</b>.
        No wallet is needed to browse blocksites, and publishing to Sui is extremely inexpensive!
    </p>
    <h2>How does it work?</h2>
    <p>
    <ul>
        <li>Each blocksite is represented by an object on Sui, which contains a <b>compressed</b> version of the blocksite
            (in this case, the <code>html</code> and <code>css</code>).</li>
        <li>Once the blocksite portal is loaded, it downloads some javascript code to <b>get the contents of the object
                from the Sui blockchain</b>, decompress it and render them in an <code>iframe</code>.</li>
        <li>People can browse any blocksite by just typing its object ID after a <code>#</code> in the blocksite portal
            url.</li>
        <li>The javascript in the portal then fetches the object from the full node, and displays it. That's it!</li>
    </ul>
    </p>
    <h2>How can i publish a blocksite?</h2>
    <p>
        Also easy: Just load up the blocksite portal, connect your wallet, and
        drag-and-drop the inlined <code>html/css/js</code>. Accept the
        transaction cost, and you have a blocksite forever!  (For more complex
        websites, a bit more tooling is needed). In case you
        are unhappy with the blocksite, you can always update it!
    </p>
