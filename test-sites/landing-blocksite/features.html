            <ul class="check-list">
                <li>Browse any blocksite, no wallet asked.</li>
                <li>Completely hosted on chain, will be availble forever to everyone™️ (or until the owner decides to destroy the object).</li>
                <li>One-click deploy of (simple) blocksites.</li>
                <li>Very cheap thanks to Sui.</li>
                <li>Link across blockpages, and seamlessly with Web2 websites.</li>
            </ul>

        <div class="column">
            <h2>Current problems</h2>
            <ul class="cross-list">
                <li>Maximum object size limits the size of each blocksite (<code>~250KB</code> compressed).</li>
                <li>The blocksite is an opaque compressed blob: Updating is almost as costly as publishing an entirely new blocksite.</li>
                <li>The blocksite portal is just a PoC.</li>
                <li><em>Cannot connect to the sui wallet!!</em></li>
            </ul>
        </div>
    </div>
    <div>
        <h2>Ideas for future improvement</h2>
        <ul class="idea-list">
            <li>Serve <code>js/css</code> from other blocks as plaintext files.</li>
            <li>Linking is quite cumbersome at the moment (need to create the Objects to get the IDs, and then update them with the content). Create tooling for that (Note: Started).</li>
            <li>Implmement the same functionality of the "blocksite portal" in a bookmarklet, so that hosting the portal is not required anymore.</li>
            <li>Add the possiblity to store the blocksite in multiple objects to get around the maximum object size limit</li>
            <li>Create tooling to split a single logical "webpage" into multiple Sui objects, according to some template. This could be interesting, e.g., to allow "multi-owner websites". For instance, a news site where individual articles are <em>actually</em> owned by individual authors, which can load anything in their "section" (the Sui object they own that is then linked in the blocksite). </li>
