            <h3>What is a Walrus site?</h3>
            <p>
                Walrus sites are "web"-sites that live entirely on Sui and Walrus, no web involved!
                The content of a Walrus site is loaded from an object on Walrus, as the object
                contains all the resources necessary to render the site. To browse a Walrus site, you
                just need its <b>Sui Object ID</b> or <b>SuiNS name</b>. No wallet is needed to
                browse Walrus site, they are accessible to everyone!
