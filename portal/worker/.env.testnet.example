# PREFERRED: Use a YAML config file instead of env vars.
# Copy ../server/portal-config.testnet.example.yaml to ../server/portal-config.yaml.
# The webpack build will read it automatically.
# You can also set PORTAL_CONFIG to point to a custom path.
#
# Env vars below are supported as overrides — if both YAML and env var
# are set for a field, the env var wins.
