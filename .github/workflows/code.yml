  # Incremental compilation is useful as part of an edit-build-test-edit cycle, as it lets the
  # compiler avoid recompiling code that hasn't changed. The setting does not improve the current
  # compilation but instead saves additional information to speed up future compilations (see
  # https://doc.rust-lang.org/cargo/reference/profiles.html#incremental). Thus, this is only useful
  # in CI if the result is cached, which we only do on the `main` branch.
